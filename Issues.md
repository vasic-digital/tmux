**Compiled:** 2026-05-08 (Phase B per-session-containerization cycle).
**Author:** Engineering coordinator
**Working pool source:** the items below feed the active task list directly.
Each item carries a current state, the captured-evidence requirement,
and a fix-direction proposal so future-self can resume cold.

> **Migration policy** (mirrors upstream `vasic-digital` projects):
> resolved items are moved to **[`Fixed.md`](Fixed.md)** in the same
> commit that closes them. **`Issues.md` holds OPEN / PARTIAL /
> BLOCKED / RUNNING / INVESTIGATED only**; once an item is closed and
> verified end-to-end, it migrates to `Fixed.md` and disappears from
> here. Never delete items outright — history matters for cold-start
> handover.

## Document conventions

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `OPEN` | Unfinished work; needs implementation + anti-bluff coverage |
| `PARTIAL` | Implementation exists but coverage gaps remain (positive evidence missing or environmental SKIP unresolved) |
| `BLOCKED` | Cannot progress without external dependency (host capability, third-party tool, distro support, etc.) |
| `RUNNING` | In-flight in this session (background process, ongoing test cycle) |
| `INVESTIGATED` | Forensic investigation produced findings; closure pending decision on fix scope |

**Status reclassification rules (§11.4.6 enforced):**

- A `PARTIAL` may not move to closed without runtime evidence
  (`/sys/fs/cgroup/.../memory.max` readback, `systemctl status` showing
  scope active, `kill -9` survivor proof — never just script exit code).
- A `BLOCKED` reclassifies to `OPEN` when the blocking dependency
  resolves; it must NOT skip directly to closed.
- An `INVESTIGATED` item must record the captured forensic trace
  (file path / command output / log timestamp) — never speculation
  ("likely" / "probably" / "appears to" — see Constitution §11.4.6).

## A. Tooling / harness gaps

(none open at this time — A1 META-MUT-001 landed in `Fixed.md`.)

---

## B. Anti-bluff completeness across the existing test surface

(none open at this time — B3 P5-M20/P5-M21 escapes CLOSED in v1.0.16
[tests 49/50 + meta-test retarget], state-verified 2026-05-29 with
`MUTATIONS CAUGHT 45 / ESCAPED 0`, and migrated to `Fixed.md` §B3;
B1 CHAL-COVER-001, B2 TEST-AUDIT-001 also landed in `Fixed.md`.)

---

## C. Per-session containerization features pending evidence

(none open at this time — C1 TMX-T5, C2 TMX-T7, C3 TMX-T8 landed in `Fixed.md`.)

---

## D. Host-capability + topology dispatch gaps

(none open at this time — D1 TOPO-DISPATCH-001 landed in `Fixed.md`.)

---

## E. Documentation / Continuation drift

(none open at this time; CONTINUATION.md §3 entries that resolve land in `Fixed.md` per Constitution §5 / §12.10.)

---

**Last reviewed:** 2026-05-22 (v1.0.14 cycle — clipboard physical-proof landing + multi-host deploy; opened B3 to track the pre-existing v1.0.9 P5-M20+P5-M21 layer-4 escapes transparently).
